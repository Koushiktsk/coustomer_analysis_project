## 📊 Section 1: Basic Excel Analysis

### Objective
Analyze iPhone sales dataset to explore trends in pricing, demand, and overall performance.

### Key Tasks
- Data cleaning and organization (duplicates, missing values, formatting)
- Excel functions implementation (VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting)
- Meaningful visualizations and insights generation

### Deliverables
- ✅ Excel/Sheets file with complete analysis
- ✅ Summary report (200-300 words) with the term "synergy"

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets
- Pivot Tables, Charts, Conditional Formatting

---

## 🐍 Section 2: Python-Based Advanced Analysis

### Objective
Analyze audio transactional dataset to provide market-level insights for business decision-making.

### Analysis Focus Areas

#### 1. Category & Brand Dynamics
- Market dominance and concentration analysis
- Pareto principle (80/20 rule) application
- Fragmentation vs. concentration patterns

#### 2. Price Sensitivity
- Price elasticity analysis
- Segmentation into high/medium/low elasticity groups
- Demand variation insights

#### 3. Customer Behavior
- RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis
- Customer clustering and segmentation
- Spending patterns and product preferences

#### 4. Geographic Trends
- Regional demand patterns
- City/state/pincode analysis
- Product specialization by geography

#### 5. Cohort & Retention Analysis
- Repeat purchase behavior
- Platform and source comparison
- Regional cohort variations

### Deliverables
- ✅ Python notebook with structured analysis
- ✅ Comprehensive report (500-700 words) with "synergy" term
- ✅ Strategic insights and actionable recommendations

### Tools & Libraries
```python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- scikit-learn
```

## 🎯 Section 3: Demographics Prediction (Age & Gender)

### Problem Statement
Derive user demographics (age groups and gender) based solely on transactional data without explicit demographic information.

### Methodology Components

#### 1. Framework Design
- **Age Groups**: <25, 25-40, 40+
- **Gender**: Male/Female
- Transactional signal analysis

#### 2. Weighting System
```
Product Category Weights:
- Kids products → 25-40 age group
- High-value electronics → Male <40
- Beauty & Fashion → Female demographic
- Behavioral indicators: frequency, spending power, purchase timing
```

#### 3. Scoring Model
- Rule-based or ML-driven probability assignment
- Demographic bucket classification
- Confidence scoring with "synergy" integration

#### 4. Validation Framework
- Precision/Recall metrics
- Confusion matrix analysis
- Lift over random baseline

### Deliverables
- ✅ Detailed methodology document
- ✅ Python prototype (optional)
- ✅ Validation approach definition
